“#1” by Rehab is blasting.\
And no – I’m not broken.\
But I’ve looked at myself, hard.

And I know this one truth:

> **If I don’t shift something soon, I’ll stay in my own damn way.**\
> And that’s not a risk I’m willing to take.

- - -

Most people?\
**Full of shit.**\
Fake talk, fake smiles, fake confidence.\
They act deep and say nothing.\
And yeah – I see right through them.

But I won’t let their bullshit be the reason I rot from the inside.

I don’t need to change for them.\
**They won’t.**\
They don’t want to.\
They can’t even see past their own reflection.

So no.\
**This isn’t for them.**

This is for **me.**

So I don’t keep bottling shit until I choke on it.\
So I don’t waste my energy proving something to people who aren’t even real.\
So I don’t die of frustration in a world that claps for mediocrity.

I’ll change because:

> **I want to stay sharp.\
> I want to stay clean in the head.\
> I want to live how I actually feel – not how I think I’m supposed to.**
>
> For my health.\
> For my peace.\
> For my freedom.
>
> And yeah – for the kid I was,\
> who knew he was different,\
> and didn’t want to fake it just to fit in.\*\*

This isn’t about healing.\
It’s about **evolving**.\
Because I’m not here to play the game.\
I’m here to **become someone I don’t have to escape from.**

*Written to “#1” by Rehab.\
By someone who’s not trying to be perfect –\
just too aware to keep living like it doesn’t matter.*
