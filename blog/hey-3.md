*Or: The Art of Looking Cool for the Internet*

# **I rode my ATV. For science.**

I’d love to say this was some *epic moment of freedom.* Just me, the open road, the wind in my face, and a deep philosophical realization about life.

Reality? I drove in a straight line. Turned around. Drove back. Repeated that two more times because my friend couldn’t get a good shot.

Yes. The photo that makes me look like an unstoppable force of nature? Completely staged. Like every *“candid”* photo on the internet. The only thing real about this was my increasing frustration and the fact that I now know the exact distance required to make a perfect ATV U-turn without embarrassing myself.

Somewhere around lap three, I started questioning my life choices. *Why am I doing this? Who am I performing for? Is this what existence has been reduced to—sacrificing fuel and dignity for a slightly cooler profile picture?*

In the end, was it worth it? Maybe. The photo looks badass. But next time, I’m making my friend run alongside me instead.

#### **Lessons learned:**

1. **Every cool picture is a lie.**
2. **ATVs aren’t made for cinematic hero moments, they’re made for turning around when your idiot friend misses the shot.**
3. **I should start charging for this.**

Would I do it again? **Of course. But I’d complain the whole time.**
