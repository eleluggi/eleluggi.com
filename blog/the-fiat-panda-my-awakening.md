Or: How I Found the Ultimate Car and Reached Automotive Enlightenment

### **It all started in Trieste.**

Trieste is **one of those places that doesn’t feel real.**\
It looks Austrian, smells Italian, and functions like **neither.**

I was just walking around, taking in the weird *“Habsburg but with espresso”* vibe, when I saw it.\
And when I say *it*, I mean **him.**

A **Fiat Panda.**

But not just **any** Panda. **This** Panda.

* **White. Boxy. A rolling declaration of independence from modern car culture.**
* **Seat covers? Vintage. Probably older than me.**
* **Roof rack? There, but with no known purpose.**
* **Mysterious sticker on the hood? Adds character.**

It was **perfect.**

### **The Panda Isn’t Just a Car. It’s a Lifestyle.**

Some people look at cars and think: *How much horsepower? How fast is it? What’s the top speed?*

**Losers.**

The Fiat Panda doesn’t play that game. It **exists** on its own terms.

* **It has survived things that would kill a normal car.**
* **It’s probably had the same oil since the fall of the Berlin Wall.**
* **It has the same aerodynamics as a toaster—but who cares?**

**I﻿ like Toasters.** 

***Just to be said.***

This thing is a **cultural artifact.**

**Did you know** the original Fiat Panda was designed to be **washed out with a garden hose?**\
Meanwhile, your new luxury car **panics if it gets a water spot.**

That’s the difference between a **legend** and **overpriced scrap metal.**

### **Trieste: The Panda Capital of Europe?**

After seeing this one, I started **noticing more.**

* **Pandas everywhere.**
* **Pandas parked at impossible angles.**
* **Pandas casually existing like cockroaches after an apocalypse.**

Meanwhile, people with **giant SUVs** struggled to fit into parking spots, while a **Panda owner just effortlessly slid into a gap that barely existed.**

**That’s true power.**

### **This Car Has Done More Than You Ever Will.**

The Fiat Panda has:

* **Crossed the Sahara.**
* **Survived the Arctic.**
* **Been driven to Everest Base Camp.**

Meanwhile, your BMW **needs a software update just to unlock the windows.**

If civilization collapses tomorrow, **Pandas will still be driving.**\
That’s **why** it’s the perfect car.

### **Final Thoughts:**

1. **This is now my favorite car. No debate.**
2. **Trieste is full of old cars, and that makes it instantly better.**
3. **If I ever own a Panda, I will treat it like royalty.**

Would I trust it on a cross-country road trip? **Of course.**\
Would it make it? **Maybe.**\
Would that stop me? **Not a chance.**

Long live the Panda.
