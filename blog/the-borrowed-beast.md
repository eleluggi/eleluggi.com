*Or: Why My ATV Will Never Be the Same Again*

# **The day my fuel disappeared.**

Let’s talk about **borrowing**. A simple concept. You take something, you use it, you return it in the same condition—or at least **pretend you tried**.

So my dear friend, in his infinite wisdom, decided to borrow my ATV. No problem. I’m a generous person. A good friend. A man of the people.

**Enter the reality check.**

* **No helmet? Check.**
* **T-shirt in January? Check.**
* **Sipping iced tea like he's the CEO of bad decisions? Check.**
* **Tank? Completely drained.**

This isn’t just borrowing. This is full-scale **territorial conquest**.

The worst part? **The picture actually looks cool.** Like, magazine-cover cool. If someone took a shot like this of me, I’d frame it. But no—when *I* ride, the best my friends can capture is a blurry mess that looks like Bigfoot escaping Area 51.

And now, my ATV sits there, empty, like a warrior after battle. Will I ever see that fuel money? **Unlikely.** Would I lend it to him again? **Of course.** But next time, I’m charging interest.

### **Lessons Learned:**

1. Some people borrow things. **Others simply decide they own them now.**
2. The best photos are never of you. **Only of your idiot friends.**
3. If someone rides your ATV, just accept that you’re now financially responsible for their joyride.

Would I do it again? **Yes. But not without a deposit.**
