*Or: Why Does Every Third Car Look Like It Belongs in Texas?*

![Why??](/assets/images/pxl_20240522_082745033.jpg "Why??")

## **Vienna. A city of contradictions.**

It wants to be a **refined European capital**, but **half the cars on the road look like they were stolen from a Texas ranch.**

Explain this to me.

* This is a **city**.
* With **tight-ass streets, microscopic parking spots, and a public transport system that actually works.**
* And yet, somehow, **every third vehicle is a goddamn Dodge Ram the size of a small apartment.**

How?\
Why?\
Who is driving these things?

### **Vienna: Where Pickup Trucks Make No Sense, But Exist Anyway**

There are **zero** reasons for a truck like this in Vienna.

* **There are no farms.**
* **There are no mountains.**
* **There is no need to tow literal tons of hay or cattle.**
* **There is nowhere to park.**

And yet, **they are everywhere.**

These aren’t just any pickups. **They are massive, over-the-top, lifted monstrosities**, driven by people who:

1. **Have never seen dirt in their lives.**
2. **Would cry if they had to use the truck bed for actual work.**
3. **Somehow think Vienna traffic will part like the Red Sea for them.**

I swear, these guys wake up in the morning and say, *"Yes, let me take my 5.7L HEMI V8 through the city with the worst parking situation on the planet."*\
And for what? **For the aesthetic? For the flex?** For the dream that one day, the Ringstraße will suddenly turn into Route 66?

### **Vienna: Where Crackheads and Cowboys Coexist**

Vienna **wants** to be the **most elegant, high-class European city**—but walk five minutes too far in the wrong direction, and suddenly you’re in a **low-budget LA remake.**

* **Sketchy backstreets? Check.**
* **Dudes screaming at traffic lights? Check.**
* **People casually tweaking in broad daylight?** Absolutely.
* **Random police raids happening next to overpriced wine bars?** Standard.

At this point, I wouldn't even be surprised if I saw a **high-speed pickup truck chase ending in a full-on standoff near the Opera.**\
It just **fits** the chaotic energy.

### **Vienna is Stunning. Vienna is Trash. Vienna is Both.**

I can’t fully hate this place.\
It’s **objectively a disaster**, but it’s **a beautifully designed disaster.**

* The architecture is **gorgeous.**
* The streets are **insanely photogenic.**
* The history is **undeniable.**

And yet, **it's also the most unserious capital in Europe.**\
It’s a place where you can walk past a **UNESCO World Heritage site** while a guy in a cowboy hat revs his **Dodge Ram 1500** at a red light next to a group of crackheads having a full-blown fistfight.

I hate it.\
But I love it.\
But I hate it.

And in six months, I’ll be back—watching another oversized pickup try to fit into a parking garage designed for Fiat 500s.

### **Final Thoughts:**

1. **Vienna has an identity crisis, and it's hilarious.**
2. **Why are there so many pickup trucks? Seriously. Why?**
3. **The city is an absolute mess—but somehow, it works.**

Would I ever live here? **No.**\
Would I visit again? **Unfortunately, yes.**

**See you in six months, you chaotic, cowboy-infested fever dream of a city.**
