*Or: Why My Art Belongs in a Museum (But Only If It Has a Toilet Next to It)*

### **Somewhere in 2019 – My brain decided this needed to exist.**

Some people wake up with *visions*. Great ideas. Life-changing inspirations. I woke up and thought:\
*"You know what would be cool? A graveyard. But with UFOs. That abduct corpses. Upside down."*

So I did what any *true artist* would do:

* Opened **MS Paint** like a Renaissance master picking up his brush.
* Clicked "line tool" with the same **precision and dedication** as Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel.
* Spent *actual time* making something that **should not exist**.

And then, naturally, I **printed it out, framed it, and put it over the toilet**.

#### **Household Reactions:**

* **Mom:** *"Take that down."*

  * Fast forward a few months: **She gave up.**
* **Dad:** *"That’s actually kinda cool."*

  * A man of culture.
* **Siblings:** *"Meh."*

  * They are dead inside.
* **Me:** *"This is my legacy now."*

### **But why?**

I honestly have **no idea** how this image manifested in my brain. Maybe it’s **the logical conclusion of existing on the internet for too long**. Maybe it’s **SpaceX propaganda gone wrong**. Maybe I just really like the **concept of aliens misunderstanding how human bodies work**.

Whatever the reason, one thing is certain: **This is art now.**

And because **true art belongs where people have time to reflect**, the bathroom was the only logical place for it. You’re welcome.

### **Lessons Learned:**

1. **If you confidently frame something, people start believing it has meaning.**
2. **Persistence beats parental resistance.**
3. **Bathroom art is the purest form of self-expression.**

Would I do it again? **Yes. In fact, I think I need a series.**

**Final Thought:**\
Some artists dream of hanging in the Louvre. **I aim higher.**

Above the toilet.

Because that’s where true genius belongs.
