I’m sitting in my family’s dining room, phone in one hand, Pepsi in the other, just trying to exist in peace. And I already know—if I say this out loud, someone’s gonna act like I just insulted their entire family lineage.

Because apparently, liking Pepsi is a crime. People act like Coke is some flawless, untouchable masterpiece, and Pepsi is the weird cousin nobody talks about.

But here’s the thing—Coke isn’t even the same everywhere. The Coke in the US? Made with high-fructose corn syrup. The Coke in Europe? Regular sugar. So technically, if you’re in the US, you’re not even drinking the "real" Coke. You’re drinking some weird, corn-based experiment. Meanwhile, Pepsi? Pepsi has stayed consistent. No sugar conspiracy, no variations depending on your zip code—just straight-up, smooth, drinkable soda.

And let’s talk about taste. Coke is like drinking pure acid with a side of regret. Pepsi is smoother, less aggressive, and doesn’t feel like it’s trying to dissolve my esophagus in real-time.

Also, fun fact: Every time there’s a blind taste test, Pepsi wins. But the second people see the label, they’re like “Ew, Pepsi? I only drink Coke.” Yeah, okay, Dave. Maybe explain why you just chugged a full Pepsi thinking it was Coke.

Look, I’m not saying Pepsi is the greatest thing ever. I’m just saying—maybe stop acting like Coke is some ancient treasure passed down through generations when it’s literally just brown sugar water with a better marketing team.

Anyway, I should probably finish this Pepsi before someone in my family starts arguing with me about it. And knowing them, that’s about five seconds away.
