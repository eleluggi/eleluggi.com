Or: The Most Underwhelming Birthday Gift in History

# **I am now 21. This is my legacy.**

Some people get watches for their 21th birthday.\
Some get vacations. Cars. A wild party.

Me?\
I got a **POÄNG.**

#### **How did we get here?**

Flashback: Early 2010s.\
A small, clueless child (me) is dragged through IKEA. My mother, in a rare attempt at diplomacy, says:

*"Pick a chair. It’ll be your birthday gift."*

And I, in my infinite wisdom, chose the **mini POÄNG.**\
Not because I loved it. Not because I had a deep emotional connection to it.\
Just because I had **no better idea.**

Fast forward. 2025.\
New IKEA trip. Same situation. Same lack of decision-making skills. Same **tired mother**, who once again asks:

*"Pick a chair."*

And so I did the only logical thing. **I completed the cycle.**\
I bought the **exact same chair**, just bigger.

#### **Was this a meaningful decision? No.**

* It’s the **ultimate last-minute "I don’t know what I want" purchase.**
* It’s literally **just a chair.**
* My mom was **annoyed that I didn’t want something "proper".**

But at this point? **It’s tradition.**

### **Why POÄNG Again?**

1. **Because decision-making is exhausting.**
2. **Because I refuse to have a personality outside of childhood nostalgia.**
3. **Because apparently, "just give me the money" is unacceptable.**

So now, at 21 years old, I sit in the **adult version** of my childhood chair.\
And you know what? **It’s fine.**\
Not amazing. Not terrible. Just... **fine.**

A **boring, perfectly acceptable, emotionally empty chair.**

### **Lessons Learned:**

1. **Some people evolve. Some just buy the same chair again.**
2. **My mother will never accept "money" as a real gift.**
3. **IKEA furniture is eternal.**

Would I do it again? **Absolutely. Because I will never learn.**

**Final Thought:**\
At 10, I had a POÄNG.\
At 20, I have a POÄNG.

If this continues, expect my **retirement home to be fully POÄNG-equipped.**
