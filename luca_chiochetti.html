  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Luca Chiochetti<br>
  <strong>Role:</strong> Creative Systems Contributor<br>
  <strong>Affiliation:</strong> <a href="https://gfndc.org">GFNDC Foundation</a><br>

  <p>Luca Chiochetti is a European-based contributor affiliated with the GFNDC â€“ Global Foundation for the Neglect of Digital Culture. As a systems-oriented thinker with a background in electrical engineering, Luca plays an instrumental role in the foundationâ€™s internal tooling, logic refinement, and design integrity across multiple preservation nodes.</p>

  <p>Originally trained at a Higher Technical Institute (HTL) in Austria, Luca has opted to forego formal academic titles, focusing instead on pragmatic innovation, interface logic, and the development of more intuitive internal processes. His work often bridges technical precision with visual and structural clarity, helping decentralize archival processes and improve internal contributor workflows.</p>

  <p>As of 2025, he supports both remote and on-site initiatives across Europe-based infrastructure layers. He is considered a key actor within GFNDCâ€™s distributed framework.</p>
